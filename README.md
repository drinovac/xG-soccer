# xG-soccer

• Expected goals metric is one of the widely used metrics in football analytics field. It allows us to evaluate team and player performance.

• In a low-scoring game such as football, final match score does not provide a clear picture of the performance. This is why more and more sports analytics turn to the advanced models like xG, which is a statistical measure of the quality of chances created and conceded.

# What is xG?
• Put simply, Expected Goals (xG) is a metric designed to measure the probability of a shot resulting in a goal.

• An xG model uses historical information from thousands of shots with similar characteristics to estimate the likelihood of a goal on a scale between 0 and 1.

• For example, a shot with an xG value of 0.2 is one that we would generally expect to be converted twice in every 10 attempts.

# How is xG calculated?
• Each xG model has its own characteristics, but these are the main factors that have traditionally been fed into the large majority of Expected Goals models: distance to goal, angle to goal, body part with which the shot was taken, and type of assist or previous action (throughball, cross, set-piece, dribble, etc…). Based on historical information of shots with similar characteristics, the xG model then attributes a value between 0 and 1 to each shot that expresses the probability of it producing a goal.
